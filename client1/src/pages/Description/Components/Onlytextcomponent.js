          Tanzania is home to some of the world's hardest to reach children. The
          United Republic of Tanzania, as it is officially known, is the largest
          country in East Africa and one of the continent’s most politically
          stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is home to Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest mountain, and Serengeti
          National Park, as well as Olduvai Gorge, a rich archaeological site
          often called “the cradle of civilization.” However, Tanzania remains a
          poor country, with a majority of the population struggling as
          subsistence farmers on semi-arid land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the country currently struggles to host some 200,000
          refugees from neighboring Burundi. Children represent 51% of
          Tanzania’s population.
        </p>
        <p>
          But only 16% of children are currently registered at birth, according
          to the latest Tanzania surveys. And that percentage is even lower in
          rural areas, making it harder to identify and help children in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          With high child mortality and a lack of access to basic services,
          there is much work to be done to help Tanzania’s children survive and
          thrive.
